# Sus

Sus is a python application that can be used to play an in real life clone of hit video game ["Among Us"](https://www.innersloth.com/games/among-us/)

As far as we were aware there were no solutions already to do this, so we created one.

This project implements several different pieces of hardware to create a fun and enjoyable game.
