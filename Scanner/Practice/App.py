""" Practice Assignment: Creating the framework

In this assignment we're going to practice building a
basic application framework.  This will have us build
a set of classes which will be representative of how
we'll eventually create the scanner's source code.

Please follow along and complete all the tasks outlined
in here.  If you are unsure of any topics I'll demonstrate
on the board or consult the Python book.

# Task : 
# import the other modules
#   all our other modules will be stored in their own files
#   We need to import each of them into our main application
#   here so we can use them.
#   use the "from ____ import *" to import everything in that file
#   first one is done already as an example.  
#   import the remaining:
#       Network
#       Rfid
#       Screen
# your code here:
# --------------------------------
from MiniGame import *

# Task : creating the App class
#   create a new class called "App"
#   create 2 functions in it:
#       __init__(self)
#       run(self)
#
#   inside each function just write the command "pass"

# your code here:
